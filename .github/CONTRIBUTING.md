# Contributing

We appreciate community pull requests and have placed this guide here to help you write a complete pull request
in as few iterations as possible.

A PR that's ready for review has the following components:

- The code that's being changed.
- Acceptance tests that cover the code's sunny path for all changed fields.
- Updated docs.
- A link to any issues the PR closes, though it isn't required that a PR be related to an open issue.

Thank you!
